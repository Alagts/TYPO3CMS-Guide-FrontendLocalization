Introduction
------------

Creating a website in multiple languages with TYPO3 can be done in a
variety of ways - as usual. Unfortunately all the options are hard to
understand unless described in a context where used. In addition, even
if you understand the context you might like to get some suggestions
for what others have found to be best-practices.

This document tries to document everything there is to know about
localization of websites with TYPO3. It should ideally mention every
feature and what it is good for. You must however make sure to use
reference documents like TSref, TYPO3 Core API etc. to look up the
exact syntaxes for the features mentioned.

Both the classic column-based web designs and the modern TemplaVoil√†
approaches are covered by the document.

Since the main goal of this document is to include all knowledge areas
of localization it might suffer from bad composition where advanced
content is mixed in here and there. A later revision could maybe make
up for this by prioritizing content better. For now that has not been
a priority. On the other hand you will come out as an expert in the
other end.
